                Our commitment to your privacy is paramount. 
                We respect and safeguard your personal information when you use our Game Room. 
                We collect only the necessary information to provide our services to you, such as your name, 
                contact details, and payment information. 
                This information is used solely for the purpose of facilitating your access 
                to the Game Room and communicating with you regarding bookings, 
                updates, and promotions. 
                We may disclose your information to trusted third-party service providers 
                who assist us in operating the Game Room, or as required by law. 
                We employ industry-standard security measures to protect your information 
                from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 
                While we strive to ensure the security of your data, no method of transmission 
                over the internet or electronic storage is entirely foolproof. 
                You have the right to request deletion of your personal information at any time, 
                subject to any legal obligations or legitimate business interests. 
                We do not knowingly collect personal information from children without 
                parental consent. Links to third-party websites or services may be present on 
                our platform, but we are not responsible for their privacy practices. 
                We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy as necessary, 
                with any changes being effective immediately upon posting the revised policy.
